# Terminal RPN Calculator
This is a little project meant to function as a decently powerful RPN calculator entirely within the terminal.
I made this because I hadn't come across an RPN calculator software I was entirely happy with.
I want this to be entirely usable from the keyboard with every possible operation having either a simple hotkey or a short command that can be quickly typed.

This is functionally complete, the only real things I'd want to implement now are configuration abilities and some display changes.
This would mostly be for the convenience of anyone else using this, which I don't expect to happen, so I'm leaving this as it is.
Maybe I'll come around and clean it up for fun. Or if for whatever reason people actually start using this.
