# Terminal RPN Calculator
This is a little project meant to function as a decently powerful RPN calculator entirely within the terminal.
I made this because I hadn't come across an RPN calculator software I was entirely happy with.
I want this to be entirely usable from the keyboard with every possible operation having either a simple hotkey or a short command that can be quickly typed.
